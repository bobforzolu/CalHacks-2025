I regret us.
Never satisfied.
Can't trust you.
Don't love you.
Always ruin things.
So selfish.
Wish we never met.
You're a burden.
Impossible to talk.
Never listen.
You're a failure.
No one cares.
No respect.
Don't care feelings.
You're pathetic.
Not the same.
Always the problem.
Make things worse.
Holding me back.
Never support.
Always complaining.
Can't stand you.
Too sensitive.
So dramatic.
Wasting my time.
Never admit wrong.
Completely selfish.
Feel trapped.
No effort.
Always arguing.
Emotionally draining.
Never there.
Take me granted.
Not safe.
You're manipulative.
You're my unhappiness.
You're ungrateful.
No appreciation.
Impossible to please.
Make excuses.
No responsibility.
Cold and distant.
No time.
So controlling.
Using me.
Disappointment.
Feel alone.
Incapable of love.
Never put me first.
Mistake.
